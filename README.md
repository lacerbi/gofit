# Absolute goodness of fit (gofit)

`gofit` computes the absolute goodness of fit via entropy estimation for discrete data.

The underlying idea is that the entropy of the data represents a hard upper bound to the goodness of fit. In other words, no model can do better than the intrinsic variability of the data. This allows to define an *absolute* goodness-of-fit metric.

The method was used in Shen & Ma (2016), and is slightly extended in Acerbi et al. (2017). See Acerbi et al. (2017), Appendix C, for a detailed description.
